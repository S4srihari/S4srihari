# 👋 Hi, I'm Srihari Ponakala

**Full-Stack Software Engineer | AI/ML and Cloud Enthusiast**

I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer with 2+ years of experience designing intelligent, scalable systems that merge machine learning with robust backend and frontend engineering. With a MS in CSE (AI/ML) from the University at Buffalo, I specialize in Web Development, Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, building cloud-native, data-driven applications that turn complex ideas into production-ready solutions.

---

💡 What I do:
I craft highly performance optimized Backend Software, Distributed systems, and APIs leveraging Python (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and Node.js, architect responsive frontends with React/JavaScript, and deploy containerized microservices on AWS using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
